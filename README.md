<h1> Weather-Application </h1>

Welcome to the Weather-Application! 

To get started, simply download the files and run the command 'npm run dev' in your terminal. The web page features a sleek header with the app name and a user-friendly navbar. The navbar includes a search input for your desired location and a convenient dropdown menu for your favorites.

Once you've found your preferred location, add it to your favorites with the click of a button, so in the future you don’t have search it again, you can simply click on it and the information for your favorite location will be displayed. If you change your mind, simply remove it by clicking on the 'X' button aligned with that location.

The main section offers a wealth of information on your selected location's weather. You'll find an icon, temperature, description, and other details like high and low temperatures, wind speed, and feels-like temperature. To begin with your current location’s weather, ensure that geolocation is turned on in your browser. Additionally, there is a section for daily weather forecasts for the next 7 days. Each day displays an icon, the day of the week, and the high temperature. 

Lastly, we include a table with hourly weather forecasts for the next 24 hours, featuring an icon, the time of day (in local time zone), temperature, feels-like temperature and description (on screens larger than 'small').
